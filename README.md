## Introduction
In the Java Dungeon Game, you'll step into a world of adventure where you control a character's movement through a unidirectional dungeon. Your task is to guide the player from the initial point to the endpoint, overcoming obstacles and challenges along the way.

## Features
- **Unidirectional Dungeon:** The dungeon is constructed using the Kruskal Algorithm, ensuring a connected and immersive gameplay experience.

- **Weapon System:** Players can engage monsters using a shooting arrow system. Monsters can be defeated with two arrows. Players can collect arrows and choose a direction to shoot. Arrows can continue shooting in the same direction as long as there is only one entrance and exit to a room.

- **Escape Mechanism:** If a monster is wounded when the player enters a room, there's a 50% chance for the player to escape. This element adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.

- **Jewelries:** During the journey to the endpoint, players can collect jewels. These treasures contribute to the excitement and challenge of the game.

## Gameplay
The game challenges you to navigate through rooms, battling monsters with your shooting arrows, and collecting jewels. Make use of your wit and strategy to overcome obstacles and reach the endpoint. Each decision you make affects your journey's outcome, so choose wisely!

## Project Highlights
- Implementation of a unidirectional dungeon using the Kruskal Algorithm for interconnectivity.
- Utilization of object-oriented programming principles to design monsters, weapons, and more.
- Adherence to Test-Driven Development for robust code and comprehensive testing.
